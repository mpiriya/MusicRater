# MusicRater
Rates music :)

What can this thing do?

- import excel files
- rate music
- sort by artist, song title, rating

What (more) do i want it to do?

- import playlists, albums directly from spotify (Spotify API?)
- find stats about what kinds of songs you like weighted depending on ratings you made for your playlist (danceability, valence, energy, tempo, loudness, speechiness, instrumentalness, liveness, acousticness, key, mode (maj/min), duration, time sig) (also from Spotify API)

Better as numbers/single figures: 
1. key (most common)
2. mode (proportion)
3. duration (average)
4. time sig (proportion)

Better as graphic: danceability, valence, energy, tempo, loudness, speechiness, instrumentalness, liveness, acousticness

Not too important: liveness, speechiness, loudness

Left with 

1. danceability
2. valence
3. energy
4. tempo
5. instrumentalness
6. acousticness
